    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons baking powder</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>3/4 cup milk</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter, melted</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>


    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>In a separate bowl, beat the egg, then add the milk, melted butter, and vanilla extract. Whisk until thoroughly combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients and stir until just combined. It's okay if the batter is slightly lumpy.</li>
        <li>Heat a lightly greased skillet or griddle over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Pour about 1/4 cup of batter onto the skillet for each pancake, spreading it slightly with the back of a spoon if needed.</li>
        <li>Cook until bubbles form on the surface of the pancake and the edges look set, about 2-3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Flip the pancake and cook for another 1-2 minutes, or until golden brown on the bottom.</li>
        <li>Repeat with the remaining batter, greasing the skillet as needed.</li>
        <li>Serve the pancakes warm with your favorite toppings such as maple syrup, fresh fruit, or whipped cream. Enjoy your fluffy pancakes!</li>
