        <li>1/2 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1/4 cup unsweetened cocoa powder</li>
        <li>1/4 cup cornstarch</li>
        <li>1/8 teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>2 3/4 cups whole milk</li>

        <li>1/2 cup semi-sweet chocolate chips</li>

    <ol>
        <li>In a medium saucepan, whisk together sugar, cocoa powder, cornstarch, and salt until well combined.</li>
        <li>Gradually pour in the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps.</li>
        <li>Place the saucepan over medium heat and cook, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens and comes to a gentle boil.</li>
        <li>Reduce the heat to low and let it simmer for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.</li>
        <li>Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in vanilla extract and chocolate chips until the chocolate is completely melted and the mixture is smooth.</li>
        <li>Pour the pudding into individual serving dishes or a large bowl.</li>
        <li>Cover with plastic wrap, ensuring that the wrap touches the surface of the pudding to prevent a skin from forming.</li>
        <li>Refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or until the pudding is chilled and set.</li>
        <li>Serve cold, optionally topped with whipped cream or chocolate shavings. Enjoy your homemade chocolate pudding!</li>
